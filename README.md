Program 1: Data Visualization and Exploration with Fashion MNIST

This program loads the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and displays some example images along with their corresponding labels. It begins by importing the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow and Matplotlib. The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's fashion_mnist.load_data() function, providing separate sets for training and testing data. The shapes of the training and testing datasets are printed to give an overview of the dataset dimensions. The program then visualizes 25 example images from the training dataset, displaying them in a 5x5 grid using Matplotlib. Each image is labeled with its corresponding class name, allowing for a visual exploration of the dataset.

Program 2: Training and Evaluation of a Neural Network Model with Fashion MNIST

This program expands upon the previous one by training a neural network model using the Fashion MNIST dataset and evaluating its performance. It begins by importing the necessary TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized, preparing it for training. A simple neural network model is defined using Keras' Sequential API, consisting of a Flatten layer to transform the input images into a 1D array, followed by a Dense hidden layer with ReLU activation, and finally a Dense output layer with softmax activation. The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metric. It is trained using the training data for 5 epochs, while also validating its performance on the test data. The model's accuracy on the test dataset is evaluated and printed, providing an assessment of its generalization performance.

These programs serve as introductory examples for working with the Fashion MNIST dataset, including data visualization and exploration, as well as model training and evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras. They can be used as starting points for further experimentation and development in machine learning projects.
